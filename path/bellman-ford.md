## Shortest Path
### Bellman-Ford
The Bellman-Ford algorithm is a graph algorithm used to find the shortest path from a source vertex to all other 
vertices in a weighted graph, even in the presence of negative weight edges (as long as there are no negative weight 
cycles). It was developed by Richard Bellman and Lester Ford Jr.
